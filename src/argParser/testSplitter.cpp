/* DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This binary tests the 'split' method. It takes three parameters.
 * The first one is the input, which is expected to be some kind of assignment.
 * The second one is the expected left hand side of the assignment,
 * and the third one is the expected right hand side of the assignment.
 *
 * That is to say, if your input is 'left=right', then the expected lhs
 * would be 'left', and the rhs would be 'right'.
 *
 * This binary splits the input, and checks if the lhs and rhs
 * are as expected.
 *
 * EXIT STATUS:
 *
 * 0 - The LHS and RHS match the expectations.
 *
 * 1 - The LHS or RHS don't match the expectations.
