This project follows a few rules:

	-> This project is comprised of modules
	-> Every module has to be capable of being built independently!!!
	-> Every module has its own set or result codes
	-> Every module provides a public API
	-> Heavy logic for each module is implemented in the private API
	-> Only opaque handles are exposed to the client
